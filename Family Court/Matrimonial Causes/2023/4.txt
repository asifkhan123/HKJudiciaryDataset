D E C I S I O N
(Summary Assessment of Costs)

------------------------

1.  On 12 December 2023, this court handed down a Decision refusing to grant leave in respect of the Respondent husband (“the husband”)’s application for leave to appeal against the court’s MPS Decision dated 7 September 2023. As directed, the Petitioner wife (“the wife”) being the winning party submitted a 2-page Statement of Costs for the court’s summary assessment, which I now do. I note that on 1 December 2023, the wife has filed a Notice to Act in Person. The husband has not lodged any objections to the wife’s Statement of Costs.

2.  In the wife’s Statement of Costs, she claimed costs in the sum of HK$132,852, with HK$100,000 being counsel fee and HK$32,852 being the solicitors’ costs and disbursements.  I find the costs as claimed being necessary and proper and I would round it up to HK$130,000, payable by the husband forthwith.
