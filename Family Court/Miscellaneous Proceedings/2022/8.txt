D E C I S I O N
(Summary Assessment of Costs)

------------------------

1.  On 28 March 2024, this court handed down a Judgment allowing the Applicant (“A”)’s appeal against Master’s Decision on his interim maintenance (“IM”) application. In the Judgment, it was ordered, inter alia, that the Respondent (“R”) shall pay HK$7,200 per month as IM to A. Costs was also ordered against R to be summarily assessed, of which I now do.

2.  In his statement of costs, A claims costs in the sum of HK$918,700 (including counsel fees of HK$125,000), but R objects and proposes a sum of HK$193,460.

3.  After considering A’s statement of costs and R’s objections, I now summarily assess A’s costs at HK$300,000.
