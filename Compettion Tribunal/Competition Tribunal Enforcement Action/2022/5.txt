1.  I have heard today a case management conference attended by the Commission and Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd Respondents and Mr Francis for the 4th Respondent. The case against the 1st, 5th and 6th Respondents were determined on 12 July 2022 by the Kam Kwong procedure. The reasons for the decision against the 1st, 5th and 6th Respondents will be handed down following a further case management conference to take place on 2 September 2022 to consider what information in the Statement of Agreed Facts should be redacted on the grounds of confidentiality and more generally the principles that guide the Tribunal when determining applications for information to be kept confidential.

2.  At the hearing today I made directions by agreement for the further conduct of the case against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, who contest liability. I made no directions in respect of the further conduct of the case against the 4th Respondent. Its position requires separate comment.

3.  The 4th Respondent does not dispute that it has contravened the First Conduct Rule. However, it has not proved possible to agree that the case against the 4th Respondent be disposed of using the Kam Kwong procedure. The reason for this is that there are a number of factual matters, which the Commission says are material, but which the 4th Respondent is not prepared to agree, because it believes them to be wrong. However, it takes the view that the matters it has admitted in its Response and an affirmation confirming the correctness of the Response are sufficient to establish that there has been a contravention of the First Conduct Rule. The principle matters that the Commission and the 4th Respondent cannot agree are:

(1)  The 4th Respondent’s Response in [14] does not admit that: (1) the 4th Respondent actively procured Tink Labs to agree to and act in accordance with the material anti-competitive arrangement, and actively provided Tink Labs with information from the 1st Respondent as to prices to enable, and with the intention that, Tink Labs implement the arrangement[1]; or (2) as a result, Tink Labs did, to the knowledge of the 1st and 4th Respondents, increase the prices of the tickets sold at the 4th Respondent from May 2016 until May 2017[2].

(2)  The 4th Respondent’s Response in [14] also claims that the 4th Respondent had no interest, financial or otherwise, in actively procuring the arrangement, which is denied by the Commission in its reply in [5.2]–[5.3].

4.  It is desirable that the case on liability against the 4th Respondent is determined by agreement if possible. However, it is necessary for either the Commission or the 4th Respondent to make an application to the Tribunal that would have this result. It is not something that the Tribunal can initiate. If the Commission and the 4th Respondent cannot agree a method between themselves for bringing the case against the 4th Respondent to an end, directions will need to be made for the progress of the case against the 4th Respondent otherwise there is a risk that it will cause a delay to the case against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents’ proceeding to trial. I will consider further at the case management conference to take place on 2 September 2022 what directions are to be made if it has not by then proved possible for the Commission and the 4th Respondent to agree a procedure for determining liability or one of them has issued an application that would have, if successful, that result.
