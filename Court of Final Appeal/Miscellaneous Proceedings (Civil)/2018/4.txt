DETERMINATION

_______________________

Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ:

1.  We are satisfied that the following questions are of great general or public importance which ought to be submitted to the Court for decision, and grant leave to appeal confined thereto, namely:

When a parent applicant, who is a foreign national with no right of abode in Hong Kong, makes an application for permission to remain in Hong Kong to take care of his/her minor child, who is a HKSAR permanent resident having the right of abode in Hong Kong, whether the Director of Immigration in considering the application is obliged, as a matter of law, to take into account the parent-and-child familyâ€™s enjoyment of applicable fundamental rights while living in Hong Kong.  (Question 1)

Whether section 11 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap 383) exempts the immigration authorities from having to take into account rights protected under the Basic Law of a child member of the family, when decisions are made by immigration authorities under immigration legislation in respect of the non-Hong Kong resident family member impacting on the integrity of the family and the enjoyment of family life in Hong Kong. (Question 2)

2.  We consider Questions 3 and 4 referred to in Form B merely to raise aspects of Question 1 and thus not independently to merit the grant of leave.

3.  Similarly, we consider that Question 5 raises questions associated with Question 2 and so does not merit independent treatment.

4.  We do not consider Question 6 a fruitful question since extensions of time necessarily raise fact specific discretionary issues including any legal aid delays.  In any event, in the present case, the substantive arguments have been fully dealt with, so that the question is academic.

5.  The appeal will be heard on 28 February 2019.
