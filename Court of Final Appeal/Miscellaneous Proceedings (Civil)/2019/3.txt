DETERMINATION

________________________

The Appeal Committee:

1.  We grant leave to appeal on the following question of law:

"Whether the Standing Order 41-05 issued by the Commissioner of Correctional Services requiring all male prisoners but not female prisoners to have their hair cut 'sufficiently close' ('盡量剪短'):

(1)  constitutes direct discrimination under section 5(1)(a) of the Sex Discrimination Ordinance, Cap 480 ('SDO') and is therefore unlawful under section 38 of the SDO; and/or

(2)  is inconsistent with Article 25 of the Basic Law of the HKSAR and is therefore unconstitutional?"

2.  The appeal will be heard on 18 February 2020.
