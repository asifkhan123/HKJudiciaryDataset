The Appeal Committee:

1.  We are satisfied that the following questions are of the requisite importance and grant leave to appeal in respect of the same, namely:

Whether the act and/or representation by one co-owner (“A”) can give rise to an easement in respect of the whole property in favour of a third party (“TP”) being created or “granted” by a proprietary estoppel which binds the other co-owner (“B”) who was not involved in, and had no knowledge of, the discussions and dealings between A and TP (“Question 1”);

If the answer to Question 1 is “no”, what is the legal significance of B’s knowledge that TP had been using the property for access and the long lapse of time before B took action to block the access. In particular, whether B’s knowing inaction can give rise to a proprietary estoppel by way of acquiescence as against B (“Question 2”).

2.  The appeal will be listed for hearing on 7 April 2025.
