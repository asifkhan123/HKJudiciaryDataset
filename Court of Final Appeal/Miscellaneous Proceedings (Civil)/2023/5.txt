DETERMINATION

____________________

The Appeal Committee:

1.  We grant leave to appeal in respect of the question of law formulated, which we are satisfied is of requisite importance, namely:

“Upon proper interpretation of Regulation 21(1)(b) of the Legal Aid Regulations, Cap. 91A, what is the extent, if any, of the abrogating effect by necessary implication against legal professional privilege at common law which is a right guaranteed constitutionally under Article 35 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong? In particular, does the abrogation by necessary implication extend to communications protected by legal professional privilege prior to the application for and/or granting of legal aid to the client?”

2.  We decline to grant leave to appeal on the “or otherwise” basis, as sought in the Notice of Application, since the applicant has not advanced any arguments additional to those in support of the application for leave in respect of the foregoing question of law.

3.  The appeal will be listed to be heard on 28 November 2023.
