DETERMINATION

____________________

The Appeal Committee:

1.  On the basis that this determination is made without prejudice to the consideration by the Court of Final Appeal of the certified questions, we give leave to appeal on the following questions:-

(1) Where the Court of First Instance does not grant an extension of time to a party to apply for leave to apply for judicial review, particularly when the hearing of the application to extend takes place at the same time as the hearing for leave to apply for judicial review, is leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal required under s 14AA(1) of the High Court Ordinance Cap 4, or is leave not required by reason of s 14AA(2) or otherwise?

(2)If leave to appeal is required, is s 14AB of the High Court Ordinance, insofar as it relates to judicial review proceedings, inconsistent with Article 82 of the Basic Law?

2.  Consideration by the Appeal Committee of the other questions sought to be certified by the applicants is to be adjourned until after the determination by the Court of Final Appeal of the two certified questions.

3.  The appeals will be heard on 19 June 2020.
