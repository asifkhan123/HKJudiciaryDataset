DETERMINATION

__________________________________

The Appeal Committee:

1. On the basis that this decision is made without prejudice to the consideration by the Court of Final Appeal of the certified questions, we give leave to appeal on the following questions of great general or public importance: -

(1) Is s 63B of the District Court Ordinance, Cap 336 inconsistent with Article 82 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and thus unconstitutional?

(2) Does the CFA have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment of the CA refusing leave to appeal to it?   

2. Consideration by the Appeal Committee of the 3rd Question sought to be certified by the applicant as well as the “or otherwise” grounds to be adjourned until after the determination of the 2 certified questions referred to.

3. The appeal will be heard on 15 May 2017.
