Chief Justice Ma:

1.  Leave to appeal is granted to the Applicant on the questions set out in paragraph 1(1) and 1(2) of the Amended Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal:-

“ In the context of the regulatory regime under the Road Traffic Ordinance Cap. 374 and its regulations governing road traffic offences and, in particular, in relation to the offence of failing to comply with a requirement indicated by a traffic sign contrary to Regulations 50(2) and 61(2) of the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations Cap. 374G ( “the Regulations”):-

(1) How does the principle of legal certainty operate and what is the extent of its requirements?

(2) Whether or not misunderstanding or ignorance of the legal requirement as indicated by a traffic sign - when such requirement is expressly set out in the Regulations and the Road Users’ Code - can give rise to a reasonable excuse under Regulation 61(2) of the Regulations?”

2.  The appeal will be heard on 4 March 2016.
