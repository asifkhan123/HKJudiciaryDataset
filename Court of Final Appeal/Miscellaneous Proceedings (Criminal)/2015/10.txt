DETERMINATION

___________________________

Mr Justice Ribeiro Ag CJ:

1.  This is an unusual case because of the numerous mis-steps that have to date unfortunately prevented the applicant from arriving at a definitive outcome determining the serious charge of drug trafficking which she faces.

2.  The circumstances have however been fully considered by the Court of Appeal in the exercise of its discretion in ordering a further retrial.  In our view, no grounds exist for interfering with that exercise of discretion.  At the retrial, it is to be expected that the jury, properly instructed, will determine whether or not there should be a conviction.

3.  We accordingly refuse leave to appeal.
