DETERMINATION

_______________________

Mr Justice Fok PJ:

1.  We grant leave to appeal on the following questions of law:

(1) Although the standard direction to the jury is that they should consider each count in the indictment separately and may accept part of a witness’s evidence and not accept other parts of the same witness’s evidence, should that direction be qualified in cases of sexual offences where the only direct evidence of commission of the offences is that of the complainant and, if so, how?

(2) What is the proper approach of an appellate court to inconsistent verdicts in cases of sexual offences where, although not logically inconsistent, they are based on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant?

2.  We also grant leave to appeal on the basis that it is reasonably arguable that the different verdicts of the jury on the indictment against the applicant resulted in substantial and grave injustice being done to him.

3.  The appeal will be heard on 20 June 2019.
