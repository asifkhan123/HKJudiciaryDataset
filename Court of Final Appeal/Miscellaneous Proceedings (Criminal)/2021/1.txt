Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ:

1.  We grant leave to appeal on the substantial and grave injustice basis on the footing that it is reasonably arguable that in ordering a third retrial for murder, the exercise of discretion by the majority of the Court of Appeal miscarried.

2.  As we made plain at the hearing, this does not include argument based on the alleged diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.

3.  The appeal will be listed for hearing on 24 June 2021.
