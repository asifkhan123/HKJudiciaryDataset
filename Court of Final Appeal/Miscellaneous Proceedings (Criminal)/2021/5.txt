DETERMINATION

_______________________

Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ:

1.  Exceptionally in this case, we are satisfied that leave to appeal should be granted on the basis that it is reasonably arguable that by reason of particular restrictions on cross-examination imposed at trial, the applicant was deprived of a fair trial and so suffered a substantial and grave injustice.

2.  The appeal will be listed for hearing on 25 November 2021.
