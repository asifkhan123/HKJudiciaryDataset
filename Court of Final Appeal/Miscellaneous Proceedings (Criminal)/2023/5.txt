DETERMINATION

______________________________

The Appeal Committee :

1.  We grant leave to appeal on the question certified by the Court of Appeal as follows, namely:

“In a jury trial, should the Liberato direction be re-framed along the following lines as suggested by the majority of the High Court in Australia in De Silva v R (2019) 375 ALR 1 at [12]:

‘(i) if you believe the accused’s evidence (if you believe the accused’s account in his or her interview with the police) you must acquit; (ii) if you do not accept that evidence (account) but you consider that it might be true, you must acquit; and (iii) if you do not believe the accused’s evidence (if you do not believe the accused’s account in his or her interview with the police) you should put that evidence (account) to one side. The question will remain: has the prosecution, on the basis of evidence that you do accept, proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt’?”

2.  We also grant leave to appeal on the following question (modifying the form of the question proposed by the applicant) as follows, namely:

“In a jury trial, under what circumstances should a Liberato direction be given? In particular, is it appropriate or necessary for it to be given in relation to a defence witness’s inconsistent statements or conflicting defence evidence?”

3.  We refuse leave on the substantial and grave injustice basis. We do not consider the allegation regarding an equivocal admission reasonably arguable. We also consider that the Mushtaq direction point peripheral and in any event, sufficiently covered within the issues raised by the second question mentioned above.

4.  The appeal will be listed for hearing on 24 November 2023.
