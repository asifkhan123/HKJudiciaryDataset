DETERMINATION

___________________________

The Appeal Committee:

1.  Leave to appeal is granted on the substantial and grave injustice ground, it being arguable that the applicant was deprived of a fair trial by the trial judge’s refusal to grant an adjournment due to the applicant’s stated inability to attend court by reason of illness and instead continuing with the trial in his absence.

2.  The appeal will be heard on 28 November 2019.
