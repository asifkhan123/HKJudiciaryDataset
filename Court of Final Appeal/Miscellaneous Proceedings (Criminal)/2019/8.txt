DETERMINATION

________________________

Appeal Committee:

1.  We are satisfied that it is reasonably arguable that there has been a substantial and grave injustice in that the conduct of the trial and the treatment of the evidence may have miscarried so that the defendant was denied a fair trial.  We grant leave accordingly.

2.  The appeal will be listed for hearing on 4 January 2021.
