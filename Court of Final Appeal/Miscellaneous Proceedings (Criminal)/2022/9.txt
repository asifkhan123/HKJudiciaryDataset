DETERMINATION

___________________________

Mr Justice Fok Ag CJ:

1.  We are satisfied that it is reasonably arguable that, in allowing the respondent’s appeal against his conviction for taking part in an unlawful assembly on the ground that it was not an irresistible inference that the respondent had taken part in the unlawful assembly alleged, the judge misapplied this Court’s judgment in HKSAR v Lo Kin Man [2021] HKCFA 37 as recently considered in HKSAR v Choy Kin Yue [2022] HKCFA 27.

2.  Accordingly, we grant leave to the appellant to appeal against the judgment below on the ground that it is reasonably arguable that, in allowing the magistracy appeal and quashing the respondent’s conviction, substantial and grave injustice has been done.

3.  The appeal will be listed to be heard on 23 June 2023.
