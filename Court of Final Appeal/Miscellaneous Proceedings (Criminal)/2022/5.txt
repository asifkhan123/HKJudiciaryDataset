DETERMINATION

____________________

The Appeal Committee:

1.  We grant leave to appeal in respect of the following questions which are of the requisite importance, namely:

(a)  “What on the true construction of the provisions of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap 455) (“OSCO”) referred to herein, was the consequence of the Judge’s decision in HCMP 1207/2014 (dated 10 August 2016) not to make a confiscation order on the basis of her conclusion that the respondent had not ‘absconded’ within the meaning of section 8(1)(a)(ii)(B)?  In particular, did this in law result in the application for a confiscation order being ‘concluded’ within the meaning of section 2(16A)(a) with the consequence that the restraint order dated 30 March 2011 was discharged by operation of section 15(5)(b)?”

(b)  “Where a person against whom proceedings under OSCO have been instituted seeks to bring an appeal against a Judge’s refusal to discharge a restraint order, is that appeal criminal or civil in nature for jurisdictional and procedural purposes?

2.  We direct that the stay of execution of the Court of Appeal’s judgment be continued pending determination of the appeal.

3.  The appeal will be listed for hearing on 28 February 2023.
