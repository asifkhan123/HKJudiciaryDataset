DETERMINATION

________________________

Chief Justice Ma:

1.  Leave is given for all three applications, on the following questions: -

(1)   What is the meaning of “agent” for the purposes of s.9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance, Cap. 201 (“the POBO”) and specifically whether a person who is under no legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation to act in relation to the affairs or business of another is that person’s “agent” for the purposes of s.9?

(2)   Whether the words “or other document” in s.9(3) of the POBO are to be construed ejusdem generis with the words which precede them and specifically whether board minutes are documents which come under this definition?

(3)   Whether or not the common law principle as espoused in R v McDonnell [1966] QB 233 and Attorney-General’s Reference (No. 2 of 1982) 1 QB 624, in the context of the offence of conspiracy to defraud or theft, namely, the principle that the mind and will of the sole director(s) are treated in law as the mind and will of the limited company, applies in the context of the statutory anti-corruption regime under the POBO and, in particular, to the offence of conspiracy for agents to use a document with intent to deceive their principal, contrary to sections 9(3) and 12(1) of the POBO and sections 159A and 159C of the Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 200?

2.  These appeals will be listed for hearing on 23 November 2016.
