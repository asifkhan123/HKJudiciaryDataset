DETERMINATION

______________________

Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ:

1.  We grant leave in respect of the following questions of law certified by the Judge (with errors corrected), namely:

“In the trial of a criminal case in the magistracy, where an unrepresented defendant, apart from giving evidence himself, has not called any witnesses (hereinafter referred to as “the specific circumstances”):

(A) Does the prosecution have the right to make a closing speech under Section 19(2) of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap.227).

(B) Is R v Au Yeung Tat-Shing and another ([1988] 1 HKLR 1) a correct interpretation of Section 19(2) of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap.227)?

(C) If the answers to both (A) and (B) are ‘Yes’, then is the unrepresented defendant’s constitutional right to have a just and fair trial infringed by the prosecution’s right under Section 19(2) of the Magistrates Ordinance to make a closing speech in the specific circumstances”?

(D) If the answer to (C) is ‘Yes’, is such infringement justified?”

2.  We refuse leave under the “substantial and grave injustice” ground.

3.  The appeal will be heard on 11 June 2018.
