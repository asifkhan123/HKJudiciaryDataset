Mr Justice Fok PJ:

1.  We grant leave to appeal on the substantial and grave injustice ground on the basis that it is reasonably arguable that the trial judge’s comments in her summing-up to the jury relying on the mistranslated portions of the applicant’s video recorded interview may have resulted in the applicant not receiving a fair trial.

2.  The appeal will be heard on 13 June 2018.
