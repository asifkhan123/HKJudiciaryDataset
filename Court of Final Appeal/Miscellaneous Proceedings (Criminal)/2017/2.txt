DETERMINATION

____________________

Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ:

1.  We grant leave to appeal in respect of the following questions of law, namely:

(a) On a proper construction, what is the meaning of “visitors” in the context of the Prison Rules, Cap 234A?

(b) If in the context of Rule 203, “visitors” bears the same meanings under Rule 48 and “friends” as a category of visitors means “personal friends” :

(i) Is Rule 203 compatible with article 6(2)(a) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights?

(ii) Is Rule 203 compatible with article 14 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights?

2.  We also grant leave on the substantial and grave injustice ground on the footing that it is reasonably arguable that the evidence was incapable of sustaining a conviction for conspiracy to defraud.

3.  The hearing will take place on 17 April 2018.
