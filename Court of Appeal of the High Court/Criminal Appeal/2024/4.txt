1.  In my view, the respondent’s concession is well made in light of their acceptance of the value of the applicant’s assistance, which may be continuing. It will be for the full Court to determine the appropriate sentencing discount to which the applicant may be entitled, having regard to any further developments in the matter as explained by the respondent.

2.  Accordingly, I grant leave on the papers to enable the applicant to appeal against his sentence.
