1.  On 29 January 2015, this Court handed down its judgment, dismissing the applicant’s application for leave to appeal against conviction.

2.  On 25 February 2015, the applicant asked this Court to certify under section 32(2) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance that the following point of law is one of great and general importance, namely:

“Can the Court of Appeal dismiss an appeal by adopting a basis of conviction which is entirely different from the basis of conviction adopted by the Jury trial Court throughout the trial?”

3.  With the consent of the parties, this Court decided to deal with the application on paper and we have considered detailed written submissions from both parties.

4.  Quite apart from the 3-week delay, we are not persuaded that the proposed point of law is arguable at all.  The application for a certificate is therefore dismissed.
