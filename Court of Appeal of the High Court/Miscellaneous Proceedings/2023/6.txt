Hon Chow JA (giving the Judgment of the Court):

1.  On 4 January 2023, the Applicant took out a summons to apply for an extension of time to appeal against the order of Deputy High Court Judge Bruno Chan (“the Judge”) dated 22 June 2020 (“the Order”) refusing to grant the Applicant leave to apply for judicial review.

2.  The intended judicial review was against the decision of the Torture Claims Appeal Board/Non-refoulement Claims Petition Office (“the Board”) dated 11 August 2017, whereby the Board dismissed the Applicant’s appeal against the decision of the Director of Immigration (“the Director”) dated 5 December 2016 rejecting the Applicant’s non-refoulement claim.

3.  Having considered the documents, we are of the view that it is appropriate to determine this application on paper without a hearing under Order 59, Rule 14A of the Rules of the High Court, Cap 4A.

BACKGROUND

4.  The Applicant is a national of Pakistan. He entered Hong Kong illegally in January 2015, and was arrested by the police in March 2015. He was subsequently convicted of the offence of undertaking unauthorized employment, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 months. After his discharge from prison, he was referred to the Immigration Department for deportation. He then raised a non-refoulement claim on the basis that if he returned to Pakistan, he would be harmed or killed by a local drug dealer for refusing to participate in his illegal activities. Details of the Applicant’s claim have been summarised by the Judge at §1 of the CALL-1 Form ([2020] HKCFI 1275).

5.  By a Notice of Decision dated 5 December 2016, the Director rejected the Applicant’s non-refoulement claim on all applicable grounds: risk of torture[1], BOR 3 risk[2], persecution risk[3] and BOR 2 risk[4] (“the Director’s Decision”).

6.  The Applicant appealed the Director’s Decision to the Board. On 11 August 2017, the Board dismissed the Applicant’s appeal, and confirmed the Director’s Decision (“the Board’s Decision”).

7.  On 26 October 2018, the Applicant filed a Form 86 to apply for leave to apply for judicial review of the Board’s Decision.

8.  However, he later wrote a letter to the Court dated 30 January 2020 requesting to withdraw his application:

“I Afzaal Ahmed (RBCL/30050/16(CZ)) would like to withdraw the judicial review as my issue in home country Pakistan is solved and I will be safe to return to home country without any torture and case against me.”

THE JUDGE’S DECISION

9.  On 22 June 2020, the Judge dealt with the leave application on paper, and refused to grant the Applicant leave to apply for judicial review for the following reasons:

“[3] On 26 October 2018 the Applicant filed a notice of application for leave to apply for judicial review of the Board’s decision, with which he was seriously late by more than 11 months, but before his application could be dealt with by the court, he wrote a letter to the court requesting to withdraw his application and stated as follows…

[4] As such and given that the basis of his non-refoulement claim no longer exists and that it would be safe for him to return to his home country, it would be appropriate that his application be dismissed instead of withdrawn, and accordingly I dismiss his leave application.”

10.  On 6 July 2021, the Judge refused the Applicant’s application by summons dated 13 April 2021 for an extension of time to appeal against the Order ([2021] HKCFI 1851). The Judge found that the Applicant’s delay of more than 9 months to lodge his intended appeal must be considered as very substantial, and was not satisfied that the Applicant had provided any good reason for his serious delay. Further, at §§8-9 of the decision, the Judge stated as follows:

“[8] More importantly, nor did he put forward any proper or valid draft or proposed grounds of appeal, or any particulars of any error in the decision, or why it may be reasonably argued that the decision was unfair or unreasonable either in his summons or affirmation, and at the hearing of his summons he just stated that he still have problem in his home country where his life would still be in danger. As such and in the absence of any error in the decision being clearly and properly identified by the applicant, I do not see any prospect of success in his intended appeal.

[9] In fact, as noted above, the decision to dismiss the applicant’s claim was made at his request and upon his own evidence that his alleged problem in his home country which formed the basis of his non-refoulement claim had been resolved, which was also supported by another document produced by the applicant at the time of his request, namely an affidavit made by a brother of his which supported his proposal to return to his family in Pakistan. If indeed his alleged problem in his home country has recurred or has not been resolved after all, he may have other reliefs to resort to within the provisions of the Immigration Ordinance, but certainly not by way of appeal against that decision.”

THIS APPLICATION

11.  By a summons taken out on 4 January 2023, the Applicant applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to appeal against the Order. In the summons, the Applicant stated the following:

“Please extend time for me to appeal because I failed to appeal as I did not get the High Court letter on time. I applied to extend time to the High but the High Court did not extend.” [sic]

12.  In his affirmation filed on the same date, the Applicant said that he did not agree with the decision of the court.

13.  In his written submissions dated 18 January 2023, the Applicant stated that he had “problem” in his country, and his enemy wanted to kill him. He also alleged that the case officer of the Immigration Department did not like him, and there were many “error[s] of process”. He failed, however, to identify the alleged error(s).

DISCUSSION

14.  In deciding whether to extend time to appeal, the court will take into account the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the chances of the appeal succeeding, and the degree of prejudice to the other party if an extension of time is granted.

15.  The prospect of success of an intended appeal is important. The court will not grant an extension of time to appeal for a hopeless appeal to be pursued: Re Adumekwe Rowland Ejike [2019] HKCA 702, at §19.

16.  The Court of Appeal’s general approach in dealing with appeals in non-refoulement cases is set out in Nupur Mst v Director of Immigration [2018] HKCA 524, at §14. In particular, in an appeal against refusal of leave to apply for judicial review in non-refoulement cases, the Court of Appeal would only examine the decision of the judge in light of the grounds advanced by the applicant. If no viable ground is put forward to reverse the judge’s decision, the appeal should be dismissed. The Court of Appeal’s role is not to examine the Board’s decision afresh as if it is a fresh application for judicial review (see Nupur Mst, at §14(6)).

17.  Further, the assessment of evidence, country of origin information, risk of harm, state protection and viability of internal relocation are primarily within the province of the Board and the Director. The court will not intervene by way of judicial review unless there is an error of law or procedural unfairness or irrationality in the decision of the Board: Re Kartini [2019] HKCA 1022. No such error of law or procedural unfairness or irrationality in the decision of the Board is shown in the present case.

18.  The Applicant has failed to point to or show any error in the Judge’s decision of 22 June 2020, and has failed to raise any viable ground of appeal against the Order.

19.  There is no prospect of success in the Applicant’s intended appeal. It is thus futile to grant the Applicant any extension of time to appeal against the Order.

DISPOSITION

20.  The application for extension of time to appeal is refused, and the Applicant’s summons taken out on 4 January 2023 is dismissed.

Hon Chu VP (giving the Judgment of the Court):

1.  This is the applicant’s renewed application for extension of time to appeal. He has filed an affirmation to support his application. Despite directions given by the Registrar of Civil Appeal, he has not lodged any written submission.

2.  Having considered the papers filed in the application, we are of the view that it is appropriate to determine the present application on paper without a hearing pursuant to Order 59 rule 14A(1)  of the Rules of the High Court, Cap. 4A.

3.  The applicant is a national of Vietnam.  On 17 July 2020, he filed a Form 86 to seek leave to judicially review a decision made on 27 July 2018.  He filed a supporting affirmation on 6 August 2020.  It is unclear from the papers whether the decision being challenged was made by the Torture Claims Appeal Board (“the Board”)  or the Director of Immigration (“the Director”)  as the applicant had named both the Board and the Director as proposed respondents and did not specify who was the maker of the decision. Nor did he exhibit a copy of the decision to his affirmation.

4.  The Form 86 did not set out any ground for seeking the relief.  In the supporting affirmation, the applicant merely stated that he could not return to Vietnam because his life would be in danger.

5.  By two letters to the Court dated 25 October 2022 and 11 November 2022, the applicant asked to withdraw his application for leave to apply for judicial review because he wanted to return to Vietnam and he could return there safely.

6.  The Judge by a Form CALL-1 dated 26 April 2023[1] dismissed the application for leave to apply for judicial review, having regard to the applicant’s request to withdraw his application, and applying the decision in Re Manik Md Mahamudun Nabi [2022] HKCA 471 at [19].  There was no determination of the application on merits.

7.  On 11 August 2023, the applicant issued a summons applying for an extension of time to appeal the Judge’s decision.  In the supporting affirmation, the applicant stated that he wished to reopen his application as he had been informed by his family members that it would be dangerous for him to return to Vietnam and that he would be killed.  He also stated that he has no means to employ a private lawyer.

8.  The Judge dealt with the summons on the papers.  By his decision handed down on 12 September 2023[2], he refused the time extension application on the ground that as his previous order had been sealed, he was officio functus and had no further jurisdiction to deal with the application (at [7]).

9.  On 9 January 2024, the applicant filed the present summons to make a renewed application to extend the time for appeal.  Although both the summons and the supporting affirmation referred to the Judge’s order dated 12 September 2023, it is clear to us that the applicant is intending to appeal the decision refusing his application for leave to judicial review (i.e. the Judge’s order dated 26 April 2023).  We have therefore treated this application as a renewed application for extension of time to appeal the order made on 26 April 2023.

10.  In considering whether to extend time for appealing against the refusal of leave to apply for judicial review, we will take into account: (1)  the length of delay; (2)  the reasons for the delay; (3)  the prospect of the intended appeal; and (4)  the prejudice to the respondent if an extension of time was granted. 

11.  By the time the applicant applied to the Judge for time extension, he was more than three months late, which is a substantial delay.  The applicant explained in his supporting affirmation filed in this application that he is unrepresented and did not have any access to legal advice.  He did not elaborate on what efforts he had made to seek assistance.  We do not consider the applicant has satisfactorily explained his substantial delay.  He therefore has to show that his intended appeal has a real prospect of success. 

12.  We will first address the Judge’s reason for refusing to extend the time for appeal.  The Judge took the view that he no longer has jurisdiction as his order dated 26 April 2023 had been sealed.  However, Order 32 rule 6 of the Rules of the High Court provides that the Court may set aside an order made ex parte. 

13.  In taking the view that he has no jurisdiction to deal with the applicant’s application for time extension, the Judge referred to the judgment of this Court (Yuen JA and Lisa Wong J)  in Re Das Purnima Rani [2019] HKCA 669 at [41]-[42].  However, the issue in that case was whether the Board was correct in its view that it was functus in refusing to reinstate the applicant’s appeal after acceding to the applicant’s request for withdrawal, which depends on whether the applicant’s withdrawal of the appeal was valid (at [29]).  It was in that context that the Court held that upon a valid withdrawal, the applicant’s appeal was no longer extant such that the Board became functus officio with no jurisdiction to take any step regarding the appeal. 

14.  The reasoning in Re Das Purnima Rani has no application to the present case, which has a different context.  Notably, the summons of 11 August 2023 was an application for extension of time to appeal.  The Judge has power under Order 59 rule 15 of the Rules of the High Court to deal with an application for extension of time of appeal. 

15.  We have not lost sight that in considering whether to extend time, the Judge would have to consider the merits of the intended appeal.  In this regard, although the intended appeal might have the effect of re-opening the applicant’s judicial review application, it was not an application to the Judge to re-open the application for leave to bring judicial review.  If time extension was given and the appeal came before the Court of Appeal, the court would be considering the correctness of the Judge’s decision and reasons given in the Form CALL-1. 

16.  In any event, even if the summons is an application to re-open his judicial review application, as noted above, the Judge has power under Order 32 rule 6 of the Rules of the High Court to deal with the application.  The Judge’s view that he was officio functus and had no jurisdiction to deal with the time extension application is accordingly misplaced.

17.  We turn now to consider the merits of the applicant’s intended appeal.  The applicant has not set out in the present summons any ground in support of his intended appeal.  He only stated in his affirmation there is a good ground of appeal which has not been considered in his leave application, without giving any details or elaborations.  The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate that his intended appeal has any prospect of success, let alone a real prospect of success. 

18.  Furthermore, the applicant had provided no ground to support his intended judicial review application.  In addition, the Form 86 was made nearly two years after the decision that he intended to judicially review.  The applicant’s application for leave to apply for judicial review is seriously out of time[3].  Given the lack of explanation for the delay and the absence of grounds to support the judicial review application, the application for leave to apply for judicial review, even if not withdrawn, would be bound to fail. 

19.  In these circumstances, the intended appeal has no merits.  It would be futile to extend the time for the applicant to appeal.  Accordingly, we dismiss the applicant’s summons filed on 9 January 2024.
