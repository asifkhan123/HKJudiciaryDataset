Hon Cheung JA:

1.  I agree with the judgment of Barma JA and the orders he proposes to make.

Hon Barma JA:

Introduction

2.  There were before us three appeals against judgments of Deputy High Court Judge Ismail SC given in relation to three petitions issued by the petitioner, Mr Dennis Kwok, pursuant to what was section 168A of the old Companies Ordinance (Cap 32), seeking orders that his beneficially owned shares in Minloy Limited, Top Master Development Limited and Wealth Island International Limited (which were registered in the names of Madam Man Pui Fong and Mr Law Joe Lok, the mother and father of the 5th respondent, Ms Helen Law) be bought out by four of the other five shareholders of those companies (“the majority shareholders”), on the grounds of allegedly unfairly prejudicial conduct on the part of the majority shareholders against him.  HCMP 1526/2013 concerned Minloy, HCMP 1527/2013 concerned Top Master, and HCMP 1528/2013 concerned Wealth Island.

3.  In each of the petitions, the 1st to 8th respondents were, respectively, Mr Albert Poon, Ms Irene Tseng (who, having unfortunately passed away before the trial, was substituted as 2nd respondent by her son and executor, Mr Solomon Tseng), Mr Norris Yang, Mr William Lo, Ms Helen Law, Asian Adventure Limited, Enchantment Properties Limited and China Funds Development Limited.  Asian Adventure, Enchantment Properties and China Funds were corporate vehicles for Irene Tseng, Norris Yang and William Lo respectively, through which they held their interests in the three companies (although, in the case of Minloy, Irene Tseng held her shares in her own name).  The majority shareholders consisted, in each case, of Albert Poon, Irene Tseng/Asian Adventure, Enchantment Properties and China Funds.  No allegations were made, and no relief was sought, against the 5th respondent, Helen Law.  Originally, the three companies were named as 9th respondents to the respective petitions, but they were removed as respondents prior to the trial by an order of Harris J at an earlier stage of the proceedings.

4.  The parties’ shareholdings were the same in respect of each of the three companies.  The petitioner held 10.714% (through his nominees - Madam Man, in the case of Minloy and Top Master, and Mr Law, in the case of Wealth Island).  Helen Law held 17.857% (again through a nominee, her mother Madam Man).  As for the majority shareholders, Albert Poon held 21.429%, Irene Tseng/Asian Adventure held 35.714%, Enchantment Properties held 7.143% and China Funds also held 7.143%.

The formation of the companies and the Shareholders’ Agreement

5.  The background to the formation of the companies can be briefly summarised as follows.  In about late 1991, Dennis Kwok and Helen Law (who at one time were cohabitees) identified an opportunity for the acquisition of some 900,000 square feet of land on Lantau Island for a price of some HK$6.80 per square foot.  In order to proceed with the acquisition, funds of HK$7,000,000 would be required.  In order to raise the necessary funds, they sought additional investors.  Mr Kwok contacted his former colleague Mr Poon, while Ms Law contacted her friend Ms Tseng.  Ms Tseng brought in Mr Lo, who in turn brought in Mr Yang.  Although each of the eventual investors knew one or more of the others, it does not appear that they all knew each other, or that they had any prior business or other relationship in which they were all involved.

6.  Following a number of meetings and site visits, the six investors agreed to pursue the proposed investment in the land.  To this end, they entered into an undated written agreement (made in about January 1992) to set out the terms on which they would enter upon the investment – this agreement has been referred to throughout as “the Shareholders’ Agreement”.  Initially, it was envisaged that the entire investment would be made through Minloy, which is the company referred to in the Shareholders’ Agreement.  However, it was eventually decided that the land should be acquired by three separate companies (i.e. the three companies), and although no further agreements were entered into in relation to Top Master and Wealth Island, it was accepted by all parties that the Shareholders’ Agreement governed the relationship of the investors in respect of all three companies.

7.  The Shareholders’ Agreement is of central importance to these proceedings.  The key arguments on the issues of whether or not there has been unfairly prejudicial conduct, both before us, and in the court below, turn on its proper interpretation.  Accordingly, it is best set out in full.  It is in the following terms (sub-clause numbers in square brackets were inserted by the Deputy Judge for ease of exposition):

“Minloy Limited

Shareholders’ Agreement Concerning the Land Acquisition on Lantau Island

1) Land Ownership

Minloy Limited (hereinafter, ‘Minloy’) is the legal entity acquiring approximately 900,000 s.f. of land on Lantau Island (for details regarding the land lots, see Attachment 1). The names of shareholders and their respective shareholdings in Minloy are listed at the end of this Agreement.

2) Funding

The total cost for this land acquisition project, including legal and transaction cost, working capital etc, is estimated to be HK$7,000,000 to be funded through:

1% - HK$70,000 paid up share capital (divided into 70 equal shares of HK$1,000 each, and each share having equal voting right of one vote per share)

99% - HK$6,930,000 shareholders’ loan, interest bearing at 2% per month compounded monthly.

Shareholders must prescribe (sic) to the loan pro-rata to their shareholding percentage. In the event the above amount is insufficient to fund the project upon approval of the new budget at a shareholders’ meeting, all shareholders will be required to subscribe to the additional loan amount pro-rata to their shareholding percentages.

3) Objective of this Project

The objective of Minloy to engage in this project is NOT for short-term gain through immediate disposal of its entire land assets.

3.1 Short-term: to allow shareholders to recuperate (sic) their initial investments with interest (on the loan), through the sale of certain ‘Non-Core land’ parcels.

3.2 Medium-term: to provide land for shareholders to enjoy as a recreational facility.

3.3 Long term: to realize the appreciation in land value on Lantau.

4) The Managers

[1] All shareholders agree to appoint Irene Tseng, Helen Law and Dennis Kwok as the Managers, responsible for:

- liaising and monitoring the progress of all relevant matters;

- commissioning an annual valuation of the land retained within the company;

- evaluating development projects for the shareholders’ approval.

[2] The Managers will receive no remuneration for their work except for reimbursement of expenses. However, when the cumulative cash receipts from sale of land/assets have reached the original investment of HK$7.0 million, the Managers are entitled to receive a bonus of 15% (to be shared equally by the 3 Managers) on perpetual basis of any future cash receipt (or payment in kind for the land sale) from sale of land/assets.

5) The ‘Core Land’

[1] The ‘Core Land’ means those lots to be retained within Minloy for the medium term, to be recommended by the Managers and as agreed upon by the shareholders from time to time.

[2] The Managers will commission an annual valuation of the ‘Core Land’ and any other lots still retained within Minloy, and report to the shareholders.

[3] In case proposals are submitted to Minloy for developments on the ‘Core Land’ (or any other lots retained by Minloy), the Managers will try their best to establish a fair market price to be recommended to Minloy as the selling price (or transfer price). In case no agreement can be reached as to what the fair market price should be, all shareholders agree to accept the latest annual valuation (as explained above) as reference for the selling price.

[4] Such development proposals can come from any shareholders, but in any case, a separate ‘Development Company’ must be used for the development projects.

6) ‘Non-Core Land’

[1] All lots except the ‘Core Land’ will be termed ‘Non-Core Land’. The Managers will use their best efforts to dispose of the ‘Non-Core Land’ as soon as possible, with the aim of allowing the shareholders to recuperate (sic) their investment and interest thereon in full.

[2] In selling any land parcels, when an ‘outside buyer’ submits an offer, the shareholders will have to approve of the sale first. The shareholders also have the first option to match the purchase offer within 7 days. If no shareholders match the offer within the period, the land will be sold to this outside buyer.

[3] Similarly, for any shareholder who wishes to purchase any of the Non-Core Land, the person can make an offer to Minloy, and the other shareholders have a 7-day first option to match the offer or to find an outside buyer who must pay at least a 10% premium over the offer price. In case more than one shareholder is interested in the same lots, the decision will be made by close tender. In any event, the selling price must be at least HK$10/s.f. or the latest valuation price, whichever is the higher.

7) Commission

The shareholders agree to pay a five percent (5%) commission to any agent, including any shareholder or Manager, for the successful sale of land to any external party other than to the shareholders. The commission percentages, set to be five percent for the time being, is subject to revision by the shareholders through a shareholders’ meeting.

8) Decision Making Process

[1] The Managers can make operational decisions on behalf of Minloy, except for those decisions which require shareholders’ approval:

- sale of any land asset;

- raising debt;

- payment of shareholders’ loan interest and principal;

- declaring and paying dividend;

- development projects;

- annual valuation of the land assets;

- transfer of shares and/or changing the share structure.

[2] Before the shareholders’ loan is fully repaid with interest, any of the above decisions require 100% agreement amongst shareholders. In the event a decision is discussed but disapproved by the same shareholder at least 2 times, on the condition that 75% of the share votes are in favour, Minloy has the right to buy back the shares from this shareholder at book value provided that his/her loan is repaid in full plus monthly interest at 2% compounded monthly. However, if the latest valuation of the land falls below the book value, such buy-back arrangement will not apply. In this case, 75% vote is sufficient for approving any of the above decisions, subject to other clauses as stated in this Agreement.

[3] After HK$7 million (cumulative) has been recuperated (sic) from land sales, a 60% vote is sufficient to approve any decisions.

9) Sale of Shares

If any shareholder wishes to sell his/her shares, the other shareholders have a 7-day first option to purchase the shares. If more than one shareholder is interested in the purchase, all those interested will jointly decide to make any offer to the selling party within 7 days.

If no shareholder is interested, the shares can be offered to any outside party, subject to all other shareholders’ approval of such a party becoming the new shareholder.

10) Disputes

All shareholders agree to resolve any disputes in good faith and friendly manner. In case any disagreements cannot be resolved otherwise, an Arbitration Committee consisting of 3 members (one being a non-shareholder, one being a Manager of Minloy, and the third being either a Manager or shareholder of Minloy, all 3 members to be accepted by the 2 disputing parties concerned) will be formed and all shareholders agree to be binded (sic) by the Committee’s decision.”

The factual background to these proceedings

8.  In her judgment, the Deputy Judge set out in some detail the events between the setting up of the companies and the final breakdown of the relationship between the parties that resulted in the petitioner bringing these proceedings.  For present purposes, however, it is sufficient to set out the key events that led to the Deputy Judge’s conclusion that there had been breaches of the Shareholders’ Agreement amounting to unfairly prejudicial conduct by the majority shareholders making it appropriate to order them to buy out the petitioner’s shareholdings in the companies.  These related to:

(1)   attempts to sell parts of the Non-Core Land;

(2)   the manner in which a Government resumption of part of the land owned by Top Master, and the compensation proceeds arising therefrom, were handled by the petitioner;

(3)   the removal of the petitioner and the 5th respondent as managers and as directors of the companies and their consequent exclusion from management of the companies;

(4)   the subsequent failure to distribute the resumption proceeds arising from the resumption of the Top Master lands;

(5)   a complaint made to the police relating to alleged wrongdoing on the part of the petitioner in drawing down funds of Top Master to obtain cashier orders in favour of the shareholders in an attempt to distribute the redemption proceeds.

9.  The first set of key events relate to the proposals presented by the petitioner and the 5th respondent for the sale of parcels of Non-Core Land.  These were as follows:

(1)   Soon after the three companies were incorporated and the land acquired, a part of the land (situated at Pui O) was sold for HK$672,804.

(2)   In September 1997, there were two offers to purchase parts of the land – an offer of HK$2,200,000 for a plot at Ngau Ku Long, and an offer of HK$15,165,414 for part of the land at Shui Hau. Neither was approved by the majority shareholders.

(3)   In November 1997, there was a further offer of HK$27,000,000 for a larger part of the land at Shui Hau, subject to payment of a consultant’s fee which would result in a net sale price of HK$15,348,430.  This was not approved by the majority shareholders either.

(4)   Finally, in July 2006, an offer of slightly over HK$10,000,000 was received from Chun Wo Construction & Engineering Co Ltd for part of the Shui Hau land.  This offer, too, was not approved by the majority shareholders.

10.  As for the Government land resumption, the sequence of events can be summarised as follows:

(1)   In June 2007, the Government informed Top Master that two plots of land at Mui Wo had been resumed, and offered compensation for such resumption.

(2)   The petitioner and 5th respondent were in favour of accepting the offer of compensation, but the majority shareholders were not keen to do so and wished to hold out for a higher level of compensation.

(3)   On 13 December 2007, the petitioner suggested that a meeting be held on 20 December 2007 to discuss the Government’s compensation offer, and other matters relating to the companies. As few of the shareholders appeared to be available on that date, the petitioner suggested that the proposed meeting be held on 26 December instead. The 2nd respondent indicated that although she could not attend that day, she would give her proxy to the 1st respondent.  The 3rd and 4th respondents did not respond.  In the event, only the petitioner and the 5th respondent attended on 26 December 2007.  At the meeting, which was treated as a board meeting of Top Master, the petitioner and 5th respondent resolved to accept the Government’s offer of compensation.

(4)   After the meeting, the majority shareholders were not informed of the resolution to accept the compensation offered.

(5)   The compensation was received on 28 January 2008, and was paid into Top Master’s bank account.  On 1 February 2008, the petitioner withdrew HK$1,260,050 from Top Master’s bank account, and deposited that amount in his personal account.

(6)   The petitioner says that he orally informed the 1st and 2nd respondents in early February (around Chinese New Year) that the resumption compensation had been received.

(7)   On 23 February 2008, the petitioner advised all the shareholders by email that the compensation monies had been received.  The email did not specifically mention the resolution to do so passed at the meeting on 26 December 2007, nor did it mention that the monies had been transferred to the petitioner’s personal bank account shortly after receipt.

(8)   This notification resulted in correspondence between the shareholders, in the course of which the 3rd respondent (on 13 March 2008) questioned the petitioner’s authority to accept the Government’s offer of compensation and also enquired as to the whereabouts of the compensation monies.

(9)   On 27 March 2008, the petitioner redeposited HK$1,260,464.83 into Top Master’s account, the increase over the sum withdrawn on 1 February 2008 apparently representing interest.

(10)   On 31 March, the petitioner explained by email that as on previous occasions when resumption compensation had been received, the managers had dealt with the matter on the basis of a board resolution (which in this case was dated 26 December 2007) and the proceeds were (as before) paid into the relevant company’s bank account.  Again, no mention was made of the fact that the proceeds had been transferred to the petitioner’s personal account and subsequently returned to Top Master.

(11)   On 2 April, the petitioner emailed the other shareholders to respond to complaints by the 3rd respondent. In this email, he mentioned having informed the 1st and 2nd respondents of the receipt of the resumption compensation in conversations with them around Chinese New Year.

(12)   On 3 April, the petitioner sent copies of the 26 December 2007 board resolution to the other shareholders.  This would appear to be the first occasion on which this was done.

(13)   In none of this correspondence did the petitioner disclose that he had transferred the resumption proceeds to his personal account where they remained for a period of nearly two months.  In his witness statement, the petitioner said that this was done to maximise interest and to facilitate the obtaining of cashier’s orders to effect payment of shares of the resumption proceeds to the individual shareholders.  In cross-examination at the trial, the petitioner also added that he was concerned that the majority shareholders were trying to freeze the managers out and he wanted to ensure that the monies could be paid to the shareholders rather than be held up in Top Master.

11.  So far as the removal of the petitioner (and the 5th respondent) as managers and directors of the companies is concerned, this came about shortly afterwards.  On 7 April 2008, EGMs of the companies were convened for 9 May 2008, at which such removal was to be considered.  At such meetings, a majority of the shareholders voted in favour of such removal.

12.  As for the subsequent failure to distribute any of the resumption compensation proceeds, the sequence of events was:

(1)   A proposal by the petitioner and 5th respondent, at the Top Master EGM held on 9 May 2008, that HK$1.2 million of the proceeds should be distributed was voted down by the majority shareholders.

(2)   Thereafter, in June 2008, the petitioner continued to chase the majority shareholders for a decision as to how to deal with the proceeds, which were idle funds in Top Master’s hands.

(3)   On 4 July 2008, the petitioner was sent extracts of the minutes of board meetings that were also held on 9 May 2008.  These noted the resolutions to remove the petitioner and 5th respondent as directors and managers passed at the EGMs held on the same date, and contained board resolutions to remove them as signatories on the companies’ bank accounts.  It does not seem, however, that this latter resolution was acted upon by informing the companies’ bankers and changing the authorised signatories of their bank accounts.

(4)   On 18 August 2008, the petitioner again reminded the other shareholders by email of the idle funds held by Top Master, and proposed that if no objection was received by the end of August, arrangements would be made to pay a dividend.

(5)   On 4 September 2008, the petitioner arranged for cashier orders in favour of each shareholder to be issued from funds in Top Master’s account so as to pay each shareholder his or her pro rata share of a distribution totalling HK$1.1 million.  He informed the other shareholders on 6 December 2008 that such cashier orders were available.  This triggered a complaint the same day from the 1st respondent to the effect that the preparation of the cashier orders and consequent removal of funds from Top Master was done without board approval and amounted to criminal conduct.

(6)   Matters having remained at an impasse for a considerable time, on 23 January 2013 the petitioner arranged for the cashier orders to be cancelled with the proceeds being paid into his personal account.

13.  The complaint to the police against the petitioner arose from the preparation of the cashier orders mentioned in paragraph 12(5) above.  Following the 1st respondent’s complaint of 6 December 2008, in January 2009 a board resolution of Top Master was passed authorising the 1st respondent to make a report to the police alleging theft by the petitioner from Top Master of the amount of the cashier orders.  The 1st respondent made such a report on 18 January 2009.  The Deputy Judge found that, in making the report, the 1st respondent made false statements to the police regarding Top Master’s dividend policy, and regarding whether or not Top Master owed any money to the petitioner (and the 5th respondent).  The police investigation continued for about two years, following which it was brought to an end, apparently on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to justify taking it further.

14.  It seems clear from the Deputy Judge’s findings that matters had reached an impasse, and that as from mid-2008 onwards, the two camps of shareholders (the petitioner and the 5th respondent on one side, and the majority shareholders on the other) were unable to work together in relation to the companies’ affairs.  From time to time after his removal as a manager, until the second half of 2012, the petitioner pressed for compensation for such removal.  Eventually, on 22 November 2012, the petitioner requested the majority shareholders to buy out his shares and arrange for the repayment of his shareholders’ loan to the companies, given the inability to agree on his compensation and the general impasse as to the companies’ continued activities.  Finally, on 20 June 2013, the petitioner issued the unfair prejudice petitions in respect of the companies.

The alleged unfairly prejudicial conduct

15.  In his petitions, the petitioner complained of the following allegedly unfairly prejudicial conduct by the majority shareholders:

(1)   a threat to usurp the petitioner’s powers as manager, and thwart his entitlement to his manager’s bonus under the Shareholders’ Agreement by blocking the proposed sale to Chun Wo in 2006, and demanding amendments to the
