DECISION
_________________

 

1.  In my view as the defendant has a reasonably arguable appeal on whether the plaintiff had provided sufficient evidence to support the claim for damage and as the defendant has already paid nearly $2.5 million into Court as condition for the interim stay, I will grant a stay of execution of the judgment on the same terms until the determination of the appeal. Costs of the application be in cause of the appeal.

 

 

 	(Peter Cheung)
 	Justice of Appeal
Mr Douglas Lam, instructed by T.C. Foo & Co., for the plaintiff

Mr Erik Shum, instructed by Gallant Y. T. Ho & Co., for the defendant
